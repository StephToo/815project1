project1codeINPUT.py 

This code can be used to simulate flow rates of a gas in chemical vapor deposition system or similar.

Two parameters need to be configured which flow through a probability distribution that returns random 
numerical values based on a normal distribution. A text file for each parameter's random values will be created.
The names of the files can be edited in the code. 

Project1codeOUTPUT.py 
The second program is used to analyze the outcomes from the first program. The text files will be opened and analyzed by line.
Using matplotlib library, the program will plot the two outcomes on one graph of Flow Rate vs Time. 

This information is used to better understand the behavior of gases in chemical vapor deposition systems.
